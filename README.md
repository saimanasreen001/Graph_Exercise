## Graph_Exercise:
**Problem:**
```bash
A list with some integer items is given. First calculate the sum of list items. If the sum is even perform the multiplication of the list items,
else append a random integer to the list and again compute the sum. This process is repeated a maximum of 3 times. Now, check whether the product
is even or odd. If the product is even, compute the division of the first and last item. Also if the last item is 0, return the first element of
the list and end the process by printing the division result else append a random integer to the list and again compute the product. This process
can be repeated a maximum of 3 times.
```

## Workflow:
```bash
1. add.py : consists of addition function which calculates the sum of list items.
```

```bash
2. mul.py : consists of multiplication function which calculates the product of list items.
```
```bash
3. div.py : consists of division function which calculates the division of first and last list item.
```
```bash
4. main.py : completes the given problem by calling the respective functions.
```
